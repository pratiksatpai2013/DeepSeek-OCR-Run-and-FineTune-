DeepSeek-OCR is a 3B-parameter vision model for OCR and document understanding. It uses context optical compression to convert 2D layouts into vision tokens, enabling efficient long-context processing.

Capable of handling tables, papers, and handwriting, DeepSeek-OCR achieves 97% precision while using 10× fewer vision tokens than text tokens - making it 10× more efficient than text-based LLMs.

We can fine-tune DeepSeek-OCR to enhance its vision or language performance using Unsloth demonstrating a 88.26% improvement for language understanding.
